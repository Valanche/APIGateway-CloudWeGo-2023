# APIGateway-CloudWeGo-2023
This is a simple API Gateway based on Hertz and Kitex framework.
Works on **Linux**.

The API Gateway handles incoming **HTTP POST** (**JSON** format) or **HTTP GET** requests and sends corresponding Thrift RPC requests to target services. 
Responses from the services will be returned to the client in the format of **JSON**.

The API Gateway uses **etcd** for service discovery, so you should have etcd installed first.

## Deploy
### 1 - Clone this repo to your deploy path:

```
git clone https://github.com/Valanche/APIGateway-CloudWeGo-2023.git
```
### 2 - Start etcd:
Before you deploy the API Gateway, you should make sure that your etcd center is up.

You can start etcd in the same host with the API Gateway using command: 
```
etcd
```

### 3 - Change to the directory:
```
cd APIGateway-CloudWeGo-2023/cmd/
```



### 4 - Start the API Gateway:

```
./apigateway
```
### (Optional) 5 - Check
You can check whether the API Gateway is ready using the following command:

```
curl localhost:8888/ping
```

The output should be: 
```
{"message":"pong"}
```

## Use

### Configure etcd address:
If your etcd center is deployed somewhere else, you should configure the target address in:

```
APIGateway-CloudWeGo-2023/KxCliProvider/provider.go
```

After that you should compile the code using:
```
cd APIGateway-CloudWeGo-2023/cmd/
go build -o apigateway
```

### Add IDL files:
Add the thrift idl files of your services to directory: 
```
APIGateway-CloudWego-2023/cmd/idl/
```

### Match the names and the files
Add the names of your services and the path of its idl file to :
```
APIGateway-CloudWego-2023/cmd/idl/svcPath
```
The format is:
    **serviceName + ", " + idlFilePath ( "./idl/" + idlFileName)**.

For example, I have a service named "kitex.demo", 

and it's idl file is "./idl/kxServer.thrift".

so there should be a line "kitex.demo, ./idl/kxServer.thrift" in the file "svcpath".
### Requests
Requests should be sent to :
```
$gatewayAddress:8888/api/$serviceName/$methodName
```
For example, if the API Gateway is deployed on the host whose ip address is 1.1.1.1, 

and the client want to access the "Register" method of the "kitex.demo" service, 

the request should be sent to:
```
1.1.1.1:8888/api/kitex.demo/Register
```
